One struggle I faced was aligning elements 
properly while maintaining responsiveness, 
but I overcame it by using flexbox and testing different 
screen sizes. Through trial and error, I learned how 
important it is to debug carefully and adjust styling for 
better layout control.

After 3 days of effort and continuous testing, 
I successfully accomplished the task.
