One struggle I faced was adjusting the height of the 
.collection-section, as it wasn't expanding properly to 
fit its content. After testing different CSS properties, 
I realized that using min-height instead of a fixed height 
allowed it to adjust dynamically. Through careful debugging 
and adjustments, I successfully completed the task in 6 hours.
